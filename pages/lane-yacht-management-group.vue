            <p>Keith Lane of the <a href="http://laneyachtmanagementgroup.com/">Lane Yacht Management Group</a> is the guy you want to see if you have a question about boats on Cape Cod or the South Shore. He offers a variety of services, including corporate charters, weddings at sea, sales, and more. He’s a great, helpful guy, and I very much like helping him manage his various web properties.<br> 
            <br> Keith wanted a site that he could keep track of himself without having to constantly enlist a developer. He wanted to do things like add slideshows, pages, and pictures without paying an hourly rate. We helped him set up his site and we think that he has really run with it.</p><p>If you would like more information on getting a site like Keith’s, contact us using the form below.</p>
